## 1335. Minimum Difficulty of a Job Schedule

> Hard - [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-difficulty-of-a-job-schedule/)
>
> You want to schedule a list of jobs in `d` days. Jobs are dependent (i.e To work on the `i-th` job, you have to finish all the jobs `j` where `0 <= j < i`).
>
> You have to finish **at least** one task every day. The difficulty of a job schedule is the sum of difficulties of each day of the `d` days. The difficulty of a day is the maximum difficulty of a job done in that day.
>
> Given an array of integers `jobDifficulty` and an integer `d`. The difficulty of the `i-th` job is `jobDifficulty[i]`.
>
> Return *the minimum difficulty* of a job schedule. If you cannot find a schedule for the jobs return **-1**.

### Approach 1: Bottom-up 2D DP

- Time: O(nmd), Space: O(nd)
  - Use DP. Try to cut the array into d non-empty sub-arrays. Try all possible cuts for the array.
  - Use `dp[i][j]` where DP states are i the index of the last cut and j the number of remaining cuts. Complexity is O(n * n * d).

```java
class Solution {
    public int minDifficulty(int[] jobDifficulty, int d) {
        int n = jobDifficulty.length;
        if (n < d) return -1;
        
        int[][] dp = new int[d][n];
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            dp[0][j] = j == 0 ? jobDifficulty[j] : Math.max(dp[0][j-1], jobDifficulty[j]);
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i < d; i++) {
            for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
                int max = jobDifficulty[j];
                dp[i][j] = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
                
                for (int k = j; k >= i; k--) {
                    max = Math.max(max, jobDifficulty[k]);
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][k - 1] + max);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[d-1][n-1];
    }
}
