## 521. Longest Uncommon Subsequence I

> Easy - [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-uncommon-subsequence-i/)
>
> Given two strings `a` and `b`, find the length of the **longest uncommon subsequence** between them.
>
> A **subsequence** of a string `s` is a string that can be obtained after deleting any number of characters from `s`. For example, `"abc"` is a subsequence of `"aebdc"` because you can delete the underlined characters in `"aebdc"` to get `"abc"`. Other subsequences of `"aebdc"` include `"aebdc"`, `"aeb"`, and `""` (empty string).
>
> An **uncommon subsequence** between two strings is a string that is a **subsequence of one but not the other**.
>
> Return *the length of the **longest uncommon subsequence** between `a` and `b`*. If the longest uncommon subsequence doesn't exist, return `-1`.

### Approach: Brainteaser

- Time: O(min(n, m)), Space: O(1)

```java
class Solution {
    public int findLUSlength(String a, String b) {
        return a.equals(b) ? -1 : Math.max(a.length(), b.length());
    }
}
```
