## 1522. Diameter of N-Ary Tree

> Medium - [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-n-ary-tree/)
>
> Given a `root` of an [N-ary tree](https://leetcode.com/articles/introduction-to-n-ary-trees/), you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree.
>
> The diameter of an N-ary tree is the length of the **longest** path between any two nodes in the tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.
>
> (*Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value.)*

### Approach

- Time: O(n), Space: O(height of the tree)

```java
class Solution {
    int maxLen = 0;
    
    public int diameter(Node root) {
        maxLen = 0;
        getHeight(root);
        return maxLen;
    }
    
    private int getHeight(Node node) {
        if (node == null) return 0;
        
        int first = 0;
        int second = 0;
        
        for (Node child: node.children) {
            int childHeight = getHeight(child);
            
            if (childHeight > first) {
                second = first;
                first = childHeight;
            } else if (childHeight > second) {
                second = childHeight;
            }
        }
        
        maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, first + second);
        return 1 + first;
    }
}
```
