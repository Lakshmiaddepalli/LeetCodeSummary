## 935. Knight Dialer

> Medium - [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/knight-dialer/)
>
> The chess knight has a **unique movement**, it may move two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically (with both forming the shape of an **L**). The possible movements of chess knight are shown in this diagaram:
>
> A chess knight can move as indicated in the chess diagram below:

>
> We have a chess knight and a phone pad as shown below, the knight **can only stand on a numeric cell** (i.e. blue cell).
>
> ![img](../images/phone.jpg)
>
> Given an integer `n`, return how many distinct phone numbers of length `n` we can dial.
>
> You are allowed to place the knight **on any numeric cell** initially and then you should perform `n - 1` jumps to dial a number of length `n`. All jumps should be **valid** knight jumps.
>
> As the answer may be very large, **return the answer modulo** `109 + 7`.
