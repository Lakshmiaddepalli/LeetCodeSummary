## 973. K Closest Points to Origin

> Medium - [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/)
>
> We have a list of `points` on the plane. Find the `K` closest points to the origin `(0, 0)`.
>
> (Here, the distance between two points on a plane is the Euclidean distance.)
>
> You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in.)
>
>  
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```
> Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], K = 1
> Output: [[-2,2]]
> Explanation: 
> The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
> The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
> Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
> We only want the closest K = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```
> Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], K = 2
> Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
> (The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.)

### Approach 1: Priority Queue

- Time: O(n log k), Space: O(k)

```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] kClosest(int[][] points, int K) {
        PriorityQueue<int[]> queue = new PriorityQueue<>(
            (a, b) ->  (b[0]*b[0] + b[1]*b[1]) - (a[0]*a[0] + a[1]*a[1]));
        
        for (int[] point: points) {
            queue.add(point);
            if (queue.size() > K) queue.remove();
        }
        
        return queue.toArray(new int[queue.size()][]);
    }
}
```



### Approach 2: Quick Select

- Time: O(n), Space: O(n)

```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] kClosest(int[][] points, int K) {
        quickSelect(points, K - 1, 0, points.length - 1);
        
        int[][] ans = new int[K][2];
        for (int i = 0; i < K; i++)
            ans[i] = points[i];
        return ans;
    }
    
    private void quickSelect(int[][] points, int K, int lBound, int rBound) {
        int l = lBound, r = rBound - 1;
        while (l <= r) {
            if (distance(points[l]) <= distance(points[rBound])) {
                l++;
            } else {
                swap(points, l, r);
                r--;
            }
        }
        swap(points, l, rBound);
        
        if (l == K) {
            return;
        } else if (l < K) {
            quickSelect(points, K, l + 1, rBound);
        } else {
            quickSelect(points, K, lBound, l - 1);
        }
    }
    
    private void swap(int[][] points, int i, int j) {
        int[] temp = points[i];
        points[i] = points[j];
        points[j] = temp;
    }
    
    private int distance(int[] point) {
        return point[0] * point[0] + point[1] * point[1];
    }
}
