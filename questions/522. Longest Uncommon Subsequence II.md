## 522. Longest Uncommon Subsequence II

> Medium - [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-uncommon-subsequence-ii/submissions/)
>
> Given a list of strings, you need to find the longest uncommon subsequence among them. The longest uncommon subsequence is defined as the longest subsequence of one of these strings and this subsequence should not be **any** subsequence of the other strings.
>
> A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from one sequence by deleting some characters without changing the order of the remaining elements. Trivially, any string is a subsequence of itself and an empty string is a subsequence of any string.
>
> The input will be a list of strings, and the output needs to be the length of the longest uncommon subsequence. If the longest uncommon subsequence doesn't exist, return -1.

### Approach 1: Checking Subsequence

- Time: O(x * n<sup>2</sup>), Space: O(1), where n is the number of strings and x is the average length of the strings.
- Note that if longest uncommon subsequence is there, then it will always be one of the string from the given list of strings. Using this idea, we can check each string that whether it is a subsequence of any other string. 
- If a string is not a subsequence of any other string i.e. it is uncommon , we will return maximum length string out of them. If not, return -1.

```java
class Solution {
    public int findLUSlength(String[] strs) {
        int maxLen = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < strs.length; i++) {
            boolean allUncommon = true;
            for (int j = 0; j < strs.length; j++) {
                if (i == j) continue;
                
                if (isSubseq(strs[i], strs[j])) {
                    allUncommon = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (allUncommon) maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, strs[i].length());
        }
        
        return maxLen;
    }
    
    private boolean isSubseq(String s1, String s2) {
        int i = 0;
        
        for (int j = 0; j < s2.length(); j++) {
            if (i == s1.length()) break;
            if (s1.charAt(i) == s2.charAt(j)) i++;
        }
        
        return i == s1.length();
    }
}
```



### Approach 2: Sort + Checking Subsequence

- Time: O(x * n<sup>2</sup>), Space: O(1), where n is the number of strings and x*x* is the average length of the strings.
- Since we always want the longest length, we can save some computations if sort the given set of strings based on their lengths initially.

```java
class Solution {
    public int findLUSlength(String[] strs) {
        Arrays.sort(strs, (a, b) -> b.length()-a.length());
        
        for (int i = 0; i < strs.length; i++) {
            boolean allUncommon = true;
            for (int j = 0; j < strs.length; j++) {
                if (i == j) continue;
                
                if (isSubseq(strs[i], strs[j])) {
                    allUncommon = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (allUncommon) return strs[i].length();
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
    
    private boolean isSubseq(String s1, String s2) {
        int i = 0;
        
        for (int j = 0; j < s2.length(); j++) {
            if (i == s1.length()) break;
            if (s1.charAt(i) == s2.charAt(j)) i++;
        }
        
        return i == s1.length();
    }
}
```
