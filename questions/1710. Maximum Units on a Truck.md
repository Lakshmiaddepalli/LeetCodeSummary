## 1710. Maximum Units on a Truck 

> Easy - [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-units-on-a-truck/)
>
> You are assigned to put some amount of boxes onto **one truck**. You are given a 2D array `boxTypes`, where `boxTypes[i] = [numberOfBoxesi, numberOfUnitsPerBoxi]`:
>
> - `numberOfBoxesi` is the number of boxes of type `i`.
> - `numberOfUnitsPerBoxi` is the number of units in each box of the type `i`.
>
> You are also given an integer `truckSize`, which is the **maximum** number of **boxes** that can be put on the truck. You can choose any boxes to put on the truck as long as the number of boxes does not exceed `truckSize`.
>
> Return *the **maximum** total number of **units** that can be put on the truck.*

### Approach: Sort

- Time: O(n log n), Space: O(1)

```java
class Solution {
    public int maximumUnits(int[][] boxTypes, int truckSize) {
        Arrays.sort(boxTypes, (a, b) -> b[1] - a[1]);
        
        int units = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < boxTypes.length && truckSize > 0; i++) {
            int boxNum = Math.min(truckSize, boxTypes[i][0]);
            units += boxTypes[i][1] * boxNum;
            truckSize -= boxNum;
        }
        
        return units;
    }
}
