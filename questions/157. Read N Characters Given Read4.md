### Approach: Use Internal Buffer of 4 Characters

- Time: O(n), Space: O(1)
- Keep read from `buf4` where the index `i` is still less than the target number and not `eof` (`eof` is true if the number of char read from `read4` last time is not 4.)
- In each itreation, copy the `buf4` into the `buf`. 

```java
/**
 * The read4 API is defined in the parent class Reader4.
 *     int read4(char[] buf4);
 */

public class Solution extends Reader4 {
    /**
     * @param buf Destination buffer
     * @param n   Number of characters to read
     * @return    The number of actual characters read
     */
    public int read(char[] buf, int n) {
        int i = 0; 
        char[] buf4 = new char[4];
        int buf4Len = 4;
        
      	// eof := buf4Len != 4
        while (buf4Len == 4 && i < n) {
            buf4Len = read4(buf4);
            for (int buf4Index = 0; buf4Index < buf4Len && i < n; buf4Index++) {
                buf[i] = buf4[buf4Index];
                i++;
            }
        }
        return i;
    }
}
```
