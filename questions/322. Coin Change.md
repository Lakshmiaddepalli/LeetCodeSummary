### Approach: Dynamic Programming

- Time: O(n k), Space: O(n)

```java
class Solution {
    public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
        int[] changes = new int[amount + 1];
        Arrays.fill(changes, -1);
        changes[0] = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i < changes.length; i++) {
            for (int coin: coins) {
                if (i - coin >= 0 && changes[i - coin] != -1) 
                    changes[i] = changes[i] == -1 ? 
                        changes[i - coin] + 1 : Math.min(changes[i], changes[i - coin] + 1);
            }
        }
        return  changes[amount];
    }
}
```
