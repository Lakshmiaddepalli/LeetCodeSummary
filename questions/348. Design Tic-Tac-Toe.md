## 348. Design Tic-Tac-Toe

> Medium - [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tic-tac-toe/)
>
> Assume the following rules are for the tic-tac-toe game on an `n x n` board between two players:
>
> 1. A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block.
> 2. Once a winning condition is reached, no more moves are allowed.
> 3. A player who succeeds in placing `n` of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
>
> Implement the `TicTacToe` class:
>
> - `TicTacToe(int n)` Initializes the object the size of the board `n`.
> - `int move(int row, int col, int player)` Indicates that player with id `player` plays at the cell `(row, col)` of the board. The move is guaranteed to be a valid move.
>
> **Follow up:**
> Could you do better than `O(*n*2)` per `move()` operation?



### Approach

- Time: O(1), Space: O(n)

```java
class TicTacToe {
    int n;
    int[] rows; 
    int[] cols;
    int diagonal;
    int counterdiagonal;
    int condition;

    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    public TicTacToe(int n) {
        this.n = n;
        rows = new int[n];
        cols = new int[n];
        diagonal = 0;
        counterdiagonal = 0;
        condition = 0;
    }
    
    /** Player {player} makes a move at ({row}, {col}).
        @param row The row of the board.
        @param col The column of the board.
        @param player The player, can be either 1 or 2.
        @return The current winning condition, can be either:
                0: No one wins.
                1: Player 1 wins.
                2: Player 2 wins. */
    public int move(int row, int col, int player) {
        if (condition != 0) 
            return condition;
        
        if (player == 1) {
            if (++rows[row] >= n || ++cols[col] >= n ||
            (row == col && ++diagonal >= n) ||
            (row + col == n - 1 && ++counterdiagonal >= n)) {
            condition = player;
            }
        } else {
            if (--rows[row] <= -n || --cols[col] <= -n ||
            (row == col && --diagonal <= -n) ||
            (row + col == n - 1 && --counterdiagonal <= -n)) {
            condition = player;
            }
        }
        
        
        
        return condition;
    }
}

/**
 * Your TicTacToe object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * TicTacToe obj = new TicTacToe(n);
 * int param_1 = obj.move(row,col,player);
 */
```
