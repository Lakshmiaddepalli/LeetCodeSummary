>
> Given a binary tree, flatten it to a linked list in-place.

> ```
>     1
>    / \
>   2   5
>  / \   \
> 3   4   6
> ```

### Approach 1: Recursion

- Time: O(n), Space: O(1)
- We impelemt a helper function which returns the tail of flatten node. For each node, we first flattern its both children and check if there ware a left subtree. 
- If so, we shuffle the connections around so that there is nothing on the left side anymore.
- Finally, we return the rightmost node. (In the order of: `rightTail -> leftTail -> node itself`). 

```java
class Solution {
    public void flatten(TreeNode root) {
        flattenNode(root);
    }
    
    private TreeNode flattenNode(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) return null;
        
        TreeNode leftTail = flattenNode(node.left);
        TreeNode rightTail = flattenNode(node.right);

        if (leftTail != null) {
            leftTail.right = node.right;
            node.right = node.left;
            node.left = null;
        }
        
        return rightTail != null ? rightTail : (leftTail != null ? leftTail : node);
    }
}
```



### Approach 2: Iteration with a Stack

- Time: O(n), Space: O(n)
- == **Preorder Traversal**

```java
class Solution {
    public void flatten(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return;
        // preoder
        Stack<TreeNode> stack = new Stack<>();
        stack.push(root);
        TreeNode prev = new TreeNode();
        
        while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
            TreeNode curr = stack.pop();
            prev.left = null;
            prev.right = curr;
            prev = curr;
            
            if (curr.right != null) stack.push(curr.right);
            if (curr.left != null) stack.push(curr.left);
        }
    }
}
```



### Approach 3: O(1) Space Iteration

- Time: O(n), Space: O(1)
- For a current node, we will check if it has a left child or not. If it does, we will find the last node in the rightmost branch of the subtree rooted at this left child. Once we find this "rightmost" node, we will hook it up with the right child of the current node.
- Time complexity is `O(n)`, since we process each node of the tree at most twice. First is when we actually run our algorithm on them as the  current node. The second time when we are trying to find our `rightmost`. 

```java
class Solution {
    public void flatten(TreeNode root) {
        TreeNode curr = root;
        while (curr != null) {
            if (curr.left != null) {
                TreeNode rightmost = curr.left;
                
                while (rightmost.right != null) rightmost = rightmost.right;
                
                rightmost.right = curr.right;
                curr.right = curr.left;
                curr.left = null;
            }
            curr = curr.right;
        }
    }
}
```
