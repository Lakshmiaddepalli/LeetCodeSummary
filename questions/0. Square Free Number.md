> Given a number, check if it is square free or not. A number is said to be square free if no prime factor divides it more than once, i.e., largest power of a prime factor that divides n is one. First few square free numbers are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 26, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 35, 37, 38, 39, …



### Approach:  Factorization

- Time: O(√n), Space: O(n)
- First, find all prime factors. For all prime factors, check if its square also divides n. 

```java
    public boolean isSquareFree(int n) {
        if (n % 2 == 0) {
            n /= 2;
            if (n % 2 == 0) return false;
         }

        for (int i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(n); i+=2) {
            if (n % i == 0) {
                n /= i;

                if (n % i == 0) return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
```
