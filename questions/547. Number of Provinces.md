## 547. Number of Provinces

> Medium - [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-provinces/)
>
> There are `n` cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city `a` is connected directly with city `b`, and city `b` is connected directly with city `c`, then city `a`is connected indirectly with city `c`.
>
> A **province** is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.
>
> You are given an `n x n` matrix `isConnected` where `isConnected[i][j] = 1` if the `ith` city and the `jth` city are directly connected, and `isConnected[i][j] = 0`otherwise.
>
> Return *the total number of **provinces***.

### Approach 1: DFS

- Time: O(n log n), Space: O(n)

```java
class Solution {
    public int findCircleNum(int[][] isConnected) {
        int count = 0;
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[isConnected.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < isConnected.length; i++) {
            if (!visited[i]) {
                visit(i, visited, isConnected);
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
    
    private void visit(int i, boolean[] visited, int[][] isConnected) {
        for (int j = 0; j < visited.length; j++) {
            if (isConnected[i][j] == 1 && !visited[j]) {
                visited[j] = true;
                visit(j, visited, isConnected);
            }
