## 682. Baseball Game

> Easy - [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/baseball-game/)
>
> You are keeping score for a baseball game with strange rules. The game consists of several rounds, where the scores of past rounds may affect future rounds' scores.
>
> At the beginning of the game, you start with an empty record. You are given a list of strings `ops`, where `ops[i]` is the `ith` operation you must apply to the record and is one of the following:
>
> 1. An integer `x` - Record a new score of `x`.
> 2. `"+"` - Record a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores. It is guaranteed there will always be two previous scores.
> 3. `"D"` - Record a new score that is double the previous score. It is guaranteed there will always be a previous score.
> 4. `"C"` - Invalidate the previous score, removing it from the record. It is guaranteed there will always be a previous score.
>
> Return *the sum of all the scores on the record*.
>
>  
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```
> Input: ops = ["5","2","C","D","+"]
> Output: 30
> Explanation:
> "5" - Add 5 to the record, record is now [5].
> "2" - Add 2 to the record, record is now [5, 2].
> "C" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [5].
> "D" - Add 2 * 5 = 10 to the record, record is now [5, 10].
> "+" - Add 5 + 10 = 15 to the record, record is now [5, 10, 15].
> The total sum is 5 + 10 + 15 = 30.
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```
> Input: ops = ["5","-2","4","C","D","9","+","+"]
> Output: 27
> Explanation:
> "5" - Add 5 to the record, record is now [5].
> "-2" - Add -2 to the record, record is now [5, -2].
> "4" - Add 4 to the record, record is now [5, -2, 4].
> "C" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [5, -2].
> "D" - Add 2 * -2 = -4 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4].
> "9" - Add 9 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9].
> "+" - Add -4 + 9 = 5 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9, 5].
> "+" - Add 9 + 5 = 14 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9, 5, 14].
> The total sum is 5 + -2 + -4 + 9 + 5 + 14 = 27.
> ```

> **Example 3:**

> ```
> Input: ops = ["1"]
> Output: 1

### Approach: Stack

- Time: O(n), Space: O(n)

```java
class Solution {
    public int calPoints(String[] ops) {
        Stack<Integer> records = new Stack<>();
        
        for (String op: ops) {
            if (op.equals("C"))
                records.pop();
            else if (op.equals("D"))
                records.push(records.peek()*2);
            else if (op.equals("+")) {
                int last = records.pop();
                int sum = last + records.peek();
                records.push(last);
                records.push(sum);
            } else {
                records.push(Integer.valueOf(op));
            }
        }
        
        int sum = 0;
        while (!records.isEmpty()) sum += stack.pop();
        return sum;
    }
}
