## 124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum

> Hard - [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/)
>
> Given a **non-empty** binary tree, find the maximum path sum.
>
> For this problem, a path is defined as any node sequence from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path must contain **at least one node** and does not need to go through the root.

### Approach

- Time: O(n), Space: O(height of the tree)
- **Recursion:** Implement a function `maxWeight(TreeNode)` which computes the maxmum contributioin that this and and one or zero of its subtrees could add.
  - If the max path must contains the `root`, then `maxWeight(root)` would be the answer. 
  - But this is not the case. Thus, one need to check/update the `maxSum` at each step: whether the new path with the current node as the highest node is the one for `maxSum`.

```java
class Solution {
    int maxSum = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
    
    public int maxPathSum(TreeNode root) {
        maxSum = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        maxWeight(root);
        return maxSum;
    }
    
    private int maxWeight(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return 0;
        
        int leftSum = Math.max(0, maxWeight(root.left));
        int rightSum = Math.max(0,maxWeight(root.right));
        
        maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, leftSum + root.val + rightSum);
        return root.val + Math.max(leftSum, rightSum);
    }
}
```
