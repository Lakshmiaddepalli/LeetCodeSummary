>
> Amazon has Filfillment Center in multiple cites within a large geographic region. The citiese are arranged on a graph that has been divided up like an ordinary Cartesian plane. Each city is located at an intergral (x, y) coordinate intersection. City names and locations are given in the form of three arrays: c, x and y, which are alaigned by the index to provide the city name (c[i]), and its coordinates (x[i], y[i]).
>
> Write an algorithm to determine the name of the nearest city that shares either an x or a y coordinate with the queried city. If no other cities share an x or y coordinate, return NONE. If two cities have the same distance to the queried city q[i], consider the one with an alphabetically smaller name (i.e. 'ab' < 'aba' < 'abb') as the closest choice.
>
> The distance is denoted on a Euclidean plane: the difference in x plus the difference in y.
