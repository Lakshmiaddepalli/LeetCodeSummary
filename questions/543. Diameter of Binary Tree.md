## 543. Diameter of Binary Tree

> Easy - [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/)
>
> Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the **longest** path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.
>
> **Example:**
> Given a binary tree 
>
> ```
>           1
>          / \
>         2   3
>        / \     
>       4   5    
> ```
>
> 
>
> Return **3**, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
>
> **Note:** The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

### Approach

- Time: O(n), Space: O(height of the tree)

```java
class Solution {
    int diameter = 0;
    public int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root) {
        diameter = 0;
        depth(root);
        return diameter;
    }
    
    private int getHeight(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) return 0;
        
        int leftHeight = getHeight(node.left);
        int rightHeight = getHeight(node.right);
       
        diameter = Math.max(diameter, leftHeight + rightHeight);
        return 1 + Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight);
    }
}
```
