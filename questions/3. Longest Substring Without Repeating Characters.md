> Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.



### Approch

- Time: O(n), Space: O(min(m, n)) where m is the size of charset
- **Sliding Window:** A window is a range of elements in the array/string which usually defined by the start and end indices. For each iteration, we move the right pointer if there is no duplicates in our window; otherwise, we move the left pointer until there is no duplicates. The max length so far is updated each time.
- **Optimized:** We define a `HashMap<Character, Integer>` of the characters to its index. *Note!* There might be "invalid" indices(indices before the left pointer) stored in the map. The left pointer no need to be updated in this case.

```java
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        Map<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        
        int maxLen = 0;
        
        int l = -1;
        for (int r = 0; r < s.length(); r++) {
            char c = s.charAt(r);
            if (map.containsKey(c)) l = Math.max(l, map.get(c));
            map.put(c, r);
            maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, r - l);
        }
        
        return maxLen;
    }
}
```
