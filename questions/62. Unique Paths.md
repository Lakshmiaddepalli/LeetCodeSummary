### Approach: Dynamic Programming

- Time: O(m*n), Space: O(min(n, m))

```java
class Solution {
    public int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        if (m < n) return uniquePaths(n, m);
        
        //dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] + dp[i-1][j]
        int[][] dp = new int[2][n];
        
        Arrays.fill(dp[0], 1);
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            int row = i%2;
            dp[row][0] = 1;
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
                dp[row][j] = dp[row][j-1] + dp[1-row][j];
            }
        }
        
        return dp[(m-1)%2][n-1];
    }
}
```
