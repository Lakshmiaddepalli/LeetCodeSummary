how did you hear about us

- Actually, I first heard about C3 from LinkedIn. I saw there was an opening position in C3 for new grads like me. So I did a little bit research on C3, basically from your website. I found C3 is growing fast and you have lots of interesting project in plenty of areas, including healthcare, utlity, oil& gas. And lots of big names are your customers. (3M, conEdison, shell) And I also found a project named "covid Data Lake", which intergrate multiple data sources into one APIs. I don't have much industry experience in data analysis. But according to my experiences in big data courses, and I have to say the preprocessing is the most tedious part. And researcheres can save lots of time and directly focous on their project with your APIs. 

  there is a product: Rapidly integrate data, develop analytics, and deliver AI insights without writing code - large market

**Introduction**

Hi, I'm Xiaoshi. I am a second year master student at New York University. My major is Computer Sicence. I finished my undergraduate at Lafayette College in PA. In the past two years, I have done serveral internships. And currently, I'm looking for a full time position as a Software Engineer. 

- self motivated. finish tasks and project on time even if no one pushes me.

- I'm always curious about the cutting-edge techniques in Computer Science; Willing to learn new stuffs from talks, video, technical blogs.

- I would say I'm a good team player. I enjoy collaborating with others and together we can create something cool.



**Prolifogy **

In that internship, we designed / implemented and software that is used to detect plagiarism between different programs. (These programs can be written in diff programming languages) Basically, we would like to find if two programs are similar in the term of control flow or variable usage, and report if one program copies the other.

 (we divide into two stages.) Our software has two parts: parser and analyzer. (some of team members are in charge of ) Parser: transfers their source code to a metadata file: this metadata file will describe the control flow structures and variable useage of that program.

On the other hand, The analyzer I'm working on should take two pieces of metadata as the input, use an algorithm we design to analyze these two metadata files and find if they have common structure. At the end determine if they have plagiarism heuristically. (This analyzer is written by C#)



**PrepareCare**

Our department had a project this summer, which aimed to build connection between local startup companies and college students. (mostly for college student studying business or computer science. ) I found that was pretty cool, and I really curious what a startup look like. So I registered, and luckily got a chance to contribute to a startup company called prepare care. 



This company is really small, only has two people there: one CEO and one CTO. Because they noted there are so many regulations for childcare managers to follow and so many documents for them to fill. So they decide to build an online platform for childcare facilities to collect and maintain those regulation. 



Two other students and I mainly worked on the frontend. Our Mentor worked on the backend. Participating a startup project is a quite unique experience, I did learn a lot in all aspects. In most time, if the mentor only gave a scratch on the webpage he wanted us to build, and we could design how the details look like by ourselves. Usually, we first used some image editor to draw the several designs and present to the mentor and other team members. Once the design was decided, we start write the code. 



**Inspur** 

That summer, I just graduated from Lafayette College, and the team I joint in has built a healthcare app. But they started to design and develop almost 10 years ago. So now they think the framework(AngularJS) they used for frontend is quite out of date. Thus, they decided to migrate the codebase from AgularJs to Vue.js. Specially, I was in charge of a few webpages: such as searching page of the medical products and service and product description page.

The code migration job is quite interesting. First, you need to read and review the original code, so you can learn a lot from how other people implement a feature. (Kind of like have a conversation with the other developer who facing the same problem as you.) Besides that, you think deeply if you can come up any improvement taking advantage of the framework you are using. 



**Questions:**

1. What kind of project are you working on? And if I have an opporitunity to join C3, do you have any ideas what kind of project will I work on?
2. I found this position is specificly for "new grad". Are there mentorships or training session provided to new grad?

3. Whatâ€™s the typical day in C3? Espeacilly during the covid time, are there any different between working on site versus working at home?
